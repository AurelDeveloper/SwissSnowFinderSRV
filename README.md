## SwissSnowFinderSRV

SwissSnowFinderSRV is your ultimate server script for discovering ski stations with the best snow conditions in Switzerland.

### ðŸ§± Building Steps

1. **Create Ski Station Information Table:**
   - Develop a table containing crucial ski station details, including name, coordinates, and region.

2. **Establish API Request Mechanism:**
   - Set up a robust API request mechanism to fetch the ski stations' table.
   - Initiate API requests for all ski station coordinates, aggregating the results into another comprehensive table.

3. **Implement SQL View for Meteorological Data:**
   - Integrate an SQL view to generate a summarized timeline of all meteorological data from the ski stations.
   - Enable subscriptions for snow accumulation notifications triggered by high temperatures.

4. **Devise Snow Identification Algorithm:**
   - Develop a smart algorithm to identify the ski station with the most snow in the user's chosen region, leveraging data from the SQL view.
